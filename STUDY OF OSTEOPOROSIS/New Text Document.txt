In 1986, SOF
enrolled 9,704 women and continues to track these women with clinical visits every
two years. Data from the first seven visits are now available to the public. The data
include measures of BMD, BMI, hormones, tests of strength and function, cognitive
exams, use of medication, health habits, and much more.

Some of the questions SOF can be used to answer are:
(1) Is change in BMD related to age at menopause? Considered more generally,
this is an analysis relating a time-invariant predictor, age at menopause, with
changes in the outcome, BMD.
(2) Is change in BMD related to change in BMI? This is an analysis relating a timevarying
predictor, BMI, with changes in the outcome, BMD. BMI varies quite
a lot between women, but also varies within a woman over time.
(3) Which participants are likely to maintain cognitive function into their 9th and
10th decades of life? This involves predicting the cognitive trajectory of each
of the participants from covariates and previously measured values of cognitive
function.



The SOF data you uploaded contains the following key variables:

1. **id**: Unique identifier for each participant.
2. **visit**: Visit number for the clinical assessment (e.g., visit 2, 4, 5, etc.).
3. **totbmd**: Total Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measurement.
4. **nbmd**: Specific measure of BMD (likely at a particular site, such as neck or spine).
5. **vdate**: Date of visit.
6. **v2date**: Additional date field (potentially linked to a baseline or previous visit).
7. **bmi**: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the participant during the visit.
8. **n_iadl**: Number of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living limitations.
9. **age**: Age of the participant.
10. **meno_age**: Age at menopause.
11. **del_totbmd**: Change in total BMD.
12. **base_totbmd**: Baseline total BMD value.

This dataset provides variables useful for longitudinal analysis of bone health and related factors such as BMI, age, and menopausal status over multiple visits. If you need more detailed explanations or specific analyses, please let me know!
